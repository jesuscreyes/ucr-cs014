##Description

In this assignment, I implemented a word ladder game. The player is given a start word and an end word and must come up with a "ladder" of words where each word in the ladder is no more than one letter different than the word before it and the word after it.

Here are a few word ladder examples:

* style stale state slate plate prate crate craze crazy
* brave braze blaze blame flame flams flats feats fears hears heart
* stack stark stars stirs sties stied steed stead steak
* black (*black is both the start and end word*)

This program finds the smallest word ladder given a start word and an end word. This program only works with 5 letter words.

##Specifications:

To test this function, we used the file `words5.dict` which includes a list of 5-letter words.
