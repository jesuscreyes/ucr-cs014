#Homework 5

##Data Strucure Used
* Graphs

##Description

In this assignment, my program reads in a graph file and use Dijkstra's to compute the distance from one node to all other nodes.

##Specifications:

The graph is defined in the following format via edges:

A -> B = 5

Indicating that there are two nodes with an edge between then, The start of the edge is the node A, and the end of the edge is node B. The edge has a cost of 5. I use a test graph called `test.graph` provided from my class and I wrote Dijkstra's Algorithm to process the input.
